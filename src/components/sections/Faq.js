        Transparency is how we build rapport with our partners. If we don't find
        a match because all our developers are in the middle of a project,{' '}
        <strong>we'll contact you so we can work out an arrangement</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on our agreement, we can look for a developer to match your
        needs. Or, partners will have the option to wait until a Tech Expert
        becomes available.
